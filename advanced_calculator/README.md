# Advanced Scientific Calculator

This project is an advanced scientific calculator built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, square roots, and exponentiation.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent (in degrees).
- Square root calculation.
- Exponentiation.
- Clear and delete functionalities.
- Dark mode theme for a modern look.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

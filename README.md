# Advanced Scientific Calculator

An advanced scientific calculator built with Python and [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). This project features a dark-themed GUI with smooth, modern, rounded buttons and supports both mouse and numpad keyboard inputs.

## Features

- Scientific functions: sin, cos, tan, log, ln, square root (√), and exponentiation (exp)
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Numpad and keyboard input support
- Dark theme design with modern, rounded buttons

python main.py
```

## Usage

- Click on the buttons or use your keyboard (including the numpad) to input calculations.
- Supported keys include numbers, decimal point, operators, and mapped scientific functions (e.g., press `s` for sin).
- Press `C` to clear and `DEL` to delete the last character.
- Press `=` (or Enter) to evaluate the entered expression.

## Customization
